# JIT_Compiler
A fully functional Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler built in Python, designed to compile and execute a simplified programming language on the fly. It uses Lark for parsing, LLVM IR via llvmlite for code generation, and features a modern Tkinter GUI for code input, execution, and output display.
